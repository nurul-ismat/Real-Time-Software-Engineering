# Applicability of Mobile Contact Tracing in Fighting Pandemic (COVID-19)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Bluetooth-based Contact Tracing System is proposed to simplify the detection and notification process for infected individuals. This system, crucial during the pandemic, allows organizations to track and follow up on individuals who have been in contact with confirmed cases. The purpose of this system includes defining software requirements, architecture, and user interface design for developers and stakeholders. The primary goals are identifying contacts, maintaining records of potential contacts, and ensuring follow-up with these individuals. The objectives include reducing the time needed for contact tracing, aiding health authorities in data collection, and raising user awareness of potential exposure. This system is real-time software-based.
